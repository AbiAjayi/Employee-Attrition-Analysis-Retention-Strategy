# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-Retention-Strategy
## Project Overview
I completed this project in a real-world business setting as part of an initiative to analyze employee attrition and develop an employee retention strategy. Over 4 weeks, I led the data analysis and dashboard development, collaborating with HR and leadership teams to provide actionable insights.

The goal was to answer:

Why are employees leaving?

Which groups are most at risk?

What strategies can reduce attrition and improve retention?
### Objectives
- Analyze workforce data using SQL for in-depth EDA
- Identify factors driving employee attrition
- Develop a Power BI dashboard to monitor attrition trends
- Recommend data-driven retention strategies
