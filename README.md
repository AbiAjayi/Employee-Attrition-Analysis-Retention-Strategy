## Project Overview
This project was executed in a real-world setting to help the HR leadership team understand why employees were leaving and design strategies to reduce turnover. The analysis and dashboard provided actionable insights that influenced retention initiatives for high-risk departments.

## Business Challenge
The company faced increasing attrition, particularly among early-tenure employees and critical roles like Sales and Research & Development. HR needed clear answers:

- Why are employees leaving?

- Which groups are at highest risk?

- What data-driven strategies can improve retention?

- What strategies can reduce attrition and improve retention?

## My Role and Impact
- Led end-to-end data analysis for a workforce of 2,000+ employees using SQL.
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for HR leadership to monitor attrition trends.
- Delivered insights that informed targeted retention programs (onboarding improvements, flexible work policies, and compensation adjustments).
- Enabled the business to identify 3 high-risk roles and prioritize actions, potentially reducing attrition by up to 10% in the next cycle.

## Objectives
- Analyze workforce data to uncover key attrition drivers.

- Identify high-risk groups (departments, job roles, demographics).

- Provide data-backed retention strategies.
