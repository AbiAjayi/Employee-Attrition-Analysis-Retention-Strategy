## Project Overview
This real-world project aimed to analyze employee attrition and provide actionable strategies to improve retention. Over 4 weeks, I worked closely with HR leadership to uncover the key drivers of turnover, build an interactive Power BI dashboard, and deliver insights that informed business decisions.

## Business Challenge
The company faced increasing attrition, particularly among early-tenure employees and critical roles like Sales and Research & Development. HR needed clear answers:

- Why are employees leaving?

- Which groups are at highest risk?

- What data-driven strategies can improve retention?

- What strategies can reduce attrition and improve retention?

## My Role and Impact
- Led end-to-end data analysis for a workforce of 2,000+ employees using SQL.
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for HR leadership to monitor attrition trends.
- Delivered insights that informed targeted retention programs (onboarding improvements, flexible work policies, and compensation adjustments).
- Enabled the business to identify 3 high-risk roles and prioritize actions, potentially reducing attrition by up to 10% in the next cycle.

## Objectives
- Analyze workforce data to uncover key attrition drivers.

- Identify high-risk groups (departments, job roles, demographics).

- Provide data-backed retention strategies.

## Dataset Summary
Source: Internal HR database (anonymized for confidentiality)

Records: 2,000+ employees

Key Fields: Age, Gender, Department, Job Role, Job Level, Education, Satisfaction Scores, Monthly Income, Tenure, Attrition

## Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Key KPIs: Attrition Rate, Retention Rate, Total Employees
- Attrition Analysis by Department, Job Role, Job Level
- Demographic Insights: Age, Gender, Marital Status
- Tenure-based Attrition & Career Progression
- Engagement Metrics: Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, Manager Relationship
- Overtime & Distance Impact
- Compensation Analysis: Stock Options, Salary, Hike

## Key Insights from SQL Analysis
- Overall
   - Attrition Rate: 16% | Retention Rate: 83%

   - High attrition among employees with <1 year tenure and those aged 18–24 (39%).

   - Single employees face 25% attrition.

-Sales Department
   - Attrition Rate: 20.6% (highest among all departments)

   - Sales Representatives: ~40% attrition.

   - Younger employees and overtime workers most at risk.

-Research & Development
   - Attrition Rate: 13.8% (lower than Sales but critical roles affected)

   - High attrition in Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists.

   - Engagement factors: Low relationship satisfaction (Level 1) and low job satisfaction strongly linked to exits.

- Other Key Drivers
   - Overtime: Employees working overtime show 30% attrition.

   - Distance: Employees living 15–29 km from office have higher attrition.

   - Compensation: Employees with no stock options → 24% attrition.


## Business Recommendations
- Strengthen Onboarding: Target employees with <1 year tenure to reduce early exits.
- Career Development Plans: Especially for employees with 1–5 years tenure.
- Engage Younger Workforce: Flexible policies, mentorship programs.
- Address Overtime: Implement workload balancing and flexible schedules.
- Compensation Strategy: Offer stock options and competitive pay for critical roles.
- Department-Specific Actions:

- Sales: Redesign incentive structure, improve work-life balance.

- R&D: Invest in training and engagement programs for Lab Technicians & Scientists.
